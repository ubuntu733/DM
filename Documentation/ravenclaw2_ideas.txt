From Turn-Based Dialogue Management to Event-Based Dialogue Management

# Antoine Raux 10/2005


Examples of dialogues that we want to deal with:


Example 1:
----------
S1: What can I do for you?
U2: I need to go from Carnegie Mellon (1) to the airport (2) tomorrow at five
S3: (1 from Carnegie Mellon)
S4: (2 to the airport)
S5: Leaving at five pm. 
S6: Let me check that for you.
...

What happens:
- DM executes S1
  - IM realizes S1
  - DM gets S1 output notification
- IM detects U2(1)
- DM gets U2(1) input notification
  - DM executes implicit confirm S3
  - IM realizes S3
  - DM gets S3 output notification
- IM detects U2(2)
- DM gets U2(2) input notification
  - DM executes implicit confirm S4
  - IM realizes S4
  - DM gets S4 output notification
- IM detects complete U2
- DM gets U2 complete input notification
  - DM executes implicit confirm S5
  - IM realizes S5
  - DM executes task prompt S6
  - IM realizes S6
  - DM gets S5 output notification
  - DM gets S6 output notification


Example 2:
----------
S: What can I do for you?
U: I would like schedule information...
S: aha
U: What bus goes from Carnegie Mellon to the airport?
S: ...

Example 3:
----------
S: What can I do for you?
U: I want the schedule of the 28X
S: The 28X, (1) where are you leaving from?
U: (1 yes)
U: Carnegie Mellon
S: From Carnegie Mellon, (2) and what is your destination?
U: (2 aha)
U: The airport
...
Example 4:
----------
S: What can I do for you?
U: I want to take the bus at ####### to go to downtown because I ...
S: Sorry, where did you say you want to take the bus at?
U: Squirrel Hill
S: Okay, Squirrel Hill. Going to downtown?
U: yes
S: Alright. When do you wanna travel?

Example 5 (TeamTalk task):
----------
U: Clyde, (1) go to the end of the corridor.
C: (1 yes)
C: Okay.
U: Bashful, (1) can you patrol...
B: (1 yes)
C: I found a potentially dangerous object 10 meters from
   the end of the corridor!
U: Can I have a visual on it?

Example 6 (RoomLine task):
----------
S: What can I do for you?
U: I need a room for next Tuesday between 10am and noon.
S: Next tuesday, between 9 and ...
U: no ten
S: Between 10 and noon (1). Do you need a projector?
U: (1 yes)
U: no

Ideas
-----

Event-based DM allows to deal with non-turn synchronous phenomena such as:
- understanding of partial user utterances
- backchannels (both from user and system)
- real-world tasks (e.g. robots)

Changes to the core loop
------------------------
2 alternatives to allow events to be interpreted and acted upon at any time 
(not only waiting for user inputs):

1) Agent in focus (on top of the stack) ALWAYS gets executed after each event 
BUT what "execution" entails depends on context (e.g. for a request agent
how long ago was the question last asked). Decision is made by 
OutputManager.

-> 2) DMCore has a flag indicating who has (will have) the floor at each
dialogue state. Each agent has a flag (virtual method) to state
if it requires the floor to be executed or not. At each incoming event,
agent in focus gets executed if:
        - the system has the floor
or      - the agent in focus does not require the floor

Speculative Execution
---------------------
One additional problem that has become salient with event-based processing
is that we need to roll-back agents (mostly inform/requests) that were
executed but not realized by the IM yet (i.e. they never reached the user).
I'm planning to use 2 mechanisms for that:
1) an "Undo" method on agents that cancels their execution
2) a "IsConversationSynchronous" flag on agents that, if set, prevents
   them from being executed until the conversation actually reaches
   their dialogue state
   
Canceling Sub-dialogues
-----------------------
This issue is not really related to event-based DM (i.e. it is already
a (potential) problem in RavenClaw 1.0) but came up during our discussions.
Let us consider request agent R scheduled by an agency A that has 
precondition X. Assume X is true when A is planned by its own parent agency.
Now assume that when answering to R, the user produces an input that makes X 
false. Should we remove A and its descendants (including X) from the stack?
Currently, we don't. It seems that there are clear cases where we should. 

E.g.:
U: I need a flight to Baltimore.   (ASR=GIVE ME RENTACAR INFORMATION)
S: okay, car rental information. In which city do you want a car?
U: No, flight information.
...

At this point, it seems we should completely remove from the stack the 
"CarRental" agency which was triggered by the misrecognized 
(and "misgrounded") user utterance. 
Here are two possible solutions to this problem: 
   1) during the "RemoveCompletedAgentsFromStack" phase of the core loop,
      remove agents whose preconditions have become false (instead of only the
      ones whose completion criterion has become true)
or 2) add a FAIL_WHEN_PRECONTION_FALSE directive that the dialogue designer
      can put in the task specification which is equivalent to:
      FAIL_WHEN(~precondition) (maybe with a special type of fail?)
      
Incremental Processing of Events
--------------------------------
Some events have a duration (e.g. user utterances) and are detected 
incrementally, i.e. the system gets notifications of the current progress
of the event while the event is progressing and a final notification
once the event is deemed complete. Need to look into Allen and Ferguson
(Actions and Events in Interval Temporal Logic).
