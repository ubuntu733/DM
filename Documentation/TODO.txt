
[ ] Things that might still need to happen in concepts

	... the various types of updates, might need to improve things there... so far
	things (the naive probabilistic updates) are done in the ValConf sets
	but that might need to move somewhere else
	
	[ ] need to also sort out the order and how precisely the "always" update
		updates will happen
		
	- maybe want to add a IsValid (on a CHyp... which will tell me if there's 
	  anything in there with confidence > 0)
	- add index checks everywhere in CValConfSet
	- potentially it's not necessary to write reopen in all the atomic classes
	- potentially it's not necessary to write update_Set in all the atomic classes
	- potentially it's not necessary to write update_NaiveProbabilistic in all the atomic
		classes

[ ] Why all these ON_COMPLETION(RESET) instead of ON_COMPLETION(REOPEN)
	[X] Changed them at least in the Help agents... seems fine so far

01-26-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[X] Make the output manager store pointers to the concepts for notifications
[X] Rearrange the dialogagent.h and cpp files
[X] Add logging for the binding history information
[ ] Figure out how to compute the time-series features, and also how to log
    them
[X] Develop some of the non-understanding strategies
    [ ] Discuss them with alex

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// [2004-03-03] (dbohus): added RestartTopic in the DMCore so that you can 
//  restart various agents as desired

- added SAME_AS_TRIGGER, so that you can write
    PRECONDITION(SAME_AS_TRIGGER) if you need the agent to be executed only
    when the trigger holds, and not planned for otherwise
    - actually you can obtain the same effect by saying PRECONDITION(FALSE)
      but this makes for a nicer reading i think since PRECONDITION(FALSE)
      might be a bit confusing...
    

- made changes to Generic.gra and DateTime to handle time durations

//   [2004-04-18] (dbohus):  renamed MergedHistory to 
//                            CreateMergedHistoryConcept and added a 
//                            MergeHistory function which merges the history
//                            up into the current value for a concept

- added grounding models on dialogue agents
  (you have to say SUBAGENT(X, CX, none) for now

- removed USE_ALL_GROUNDING_ACTIONS from CORE_CONFIGURATION (you will need to 
remove it to compile)
- added grounding_manager_configuration = no_grounding | full_grounding in the
configuration file. You can set it to no_grounding and everything should run
as before. 
- RoomLine.pm the getActObject changed so that we do a regexp identification of the
object (this allow explicit confirms to just send the object)
  Antoine will need to change BusLine.pm and the rest of the systems also will
  need to change their NLGs 
- Changed the behavior of HasCompleted and HasFailed so that they don't set the
completion status on the agent
    (this actually might lead to some problems if for instance an agency completes
     but later on you directly affect some of its concepts for instance in a way
     which would cause its success criterion to not be satisfied any more)
- Added some macros: FINISH_AGENT, RESET_AGENT, REOPEN_AGENT, REOPEN_CONCEPT, RESTORE_CONCEPT
- Moved both the focus claims and the grounding management phases out of the input 
  phase. Right now they will both get executed at each execution cycle, but only
  if the core is signaled to do so. Performing an input phase automatically signals
  the core to do so. You can also signal it manually (SignalGroundingPhase, etc)
- The grounding agents have dynamic ids corresponding to the concept or agent 
  which they are grouding
- Changed the structure ITEM definition so that it includes a grounding model
  I recommend not using nested grounding models;
- Changed the ARRAY concept definition to include a groudning model
- Changed TTY to display stuff that helios sends to the DM, and to send tty
  as an input source
    - to use the new TTY you need to make changed to your hub.pgm file:
        - add process_parse as an operation on tty-server
        - add a rule similar to the one that trigger DialogManager.process_parse
          make it trigger tty-sphinx.process_parse, and put the rule before the 
          one that triggers the dialog manager in your pgm file. 
    
    [X] more changes will be needed to tty to make sure it works with the changes
        antoine made. also i need a way of sending the confidence scores from 
        the tty to helios
        


[X] Added stuff for input and output classes so that no defines any more
[X] Bug fix for output when no notifications from output device
[X] Bug fix for repeat taking itself off teh stack
[X] Bug fix in execution policy getting called twice
[X] Added dynamic agent ids and # shortcut for using it
[X] Added EXECUTION_POLICY macro

[ ] Might want to add beautifiers for defining agents 
[X] and for completing agents

[ ] Might be nice to add a WhenWasTopicLastAddressedByUser and 
    WasTopicAddressedByUserInLastTurn (these might make sense only
    on agencies and request agents)

RavenClaw BUGFIX: Start dialog with a backend called used to fail

BUG: [ ] In TimeoutTerminate some expectations for yes are always open, and so 
         they catch on fire sometimes although they shouldn't. Once you fix
         that, reset the agent to be used in Madeleine         
         - Actually, turns out this is happening when there is no main topic
         of conversation well defined at the beginning of the conversation. In 
         this case, the expectation will be open

[X] Made a version of SplitOnFirst which also takes into account quoted
     substrings; changed the output manager and the traffic manager to 
     handle sending out values that are strings with spaces...
[X] Added ; in ON_COMPLETION so that if you have a single line you 
    don't have to add the semicolon yourself
        [X] notify the world


Older stuff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions:
    - incorporating flags by expanding the underlying state
    - once we have this model, how do we expand it???

SOONER:

[X] do the version info
[X] made it so that the exit on fatal error is controlled
[X] Why are the dialog.logs not created ?  - because you need to run it from 
    the bin folder for those to get created
[X] make sure the prompts are right on all the discourse agents
[X] Changed stuff so that the open request agent actually works properly 
[X] Bug (probably on barge-in, can't find some concepts to set conveyance flags)
    (seems irreproducible) - says cannot locate concept ...
    [X] Fixed stuff so that the outputs are identified by the session id
[ ] Bug in repeat - for some reason it now crashes when i say repeat
[X] Bug on output notifications, make it so that it sends the whole string
    describing the session and the dialog manager server
    
[ ] Update the NLG
    [ ] Do Old versus new information in the NLG
    [X] And <concept=string> (antoine did this)
    [X] Added logging and a act/object/version structure
    
[X] Update the automatic generation of explain_more and what_can_i_say prompts
    
[ ] Grounding
    [ ] Do the explicit confirms
    [ ] Do the implicit confirms

[X] Set confidence on forced inputs to the system (i.e. timeouts), so that you
    don't get a warning
[X] Fix the warnings in the Release version of things...

LATER:
[ ] The whole conveyance updating business
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Understand what the hell the bargein -1, -2 
[ ] Introduce operators for string comparisons, and maybe integers and floats
[ ] Make a nice script for synchrozing prompts between the DM and the NLG
[ ] Check the Concepts, make SetConveyance work virtually, put comments
    in the h files. 
[ ] Look at implementing a library agency for a set of requests
[ ] Check everywhere you use STRING_MAX and cut down the strings if they are too long
[ ] Update state manager, see what state the Core needs to expose (for now)... started
    with the iConceptsBound, need to add the others, but also other stuff...
[ ] Figure out how to represent expectation agenda as a string in a 
    more complete manner.
[ ] How can we have something execute on a concept binding ? Is that a 
	good idea ? I.E. we need right now to have an ExpectStepDone and 
	a ProcessStepDone that triggers on that. Maybe we should have 
	some sort of ON_BIND for request and expect agents...
	    [ ] Need to see how we can do on-completion on expected


[ ] Debugging: add a dumpstatus on agencies. what exacly should
	it dump ?

[ ] When an agency has no way of continuing, deal with it in 
    some manner... have a discourse agent for BSOD
   
[ ] Log everything that happens to the concepts, and think in which
    form...

[ ] implement blocking conditions on agents 

[ ] DM CORE improvements	
	[ ] Implement binding policies
		[ ] change the level description so that an entire level can be blocked
		[ ] look again at bindings in light of binding policies
			[ ] see what you want to log in there
	[ ] Logging in the DM core
	[ ] Complete bindings and input passes
	[ ] Deal with ambiguous focus shifts...


04-17-03 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] how do we isolate the concepts framework, so that it can be
    used by other modules, too ? The answer is that's not easily possible
    Postpone it until we really need it

[X] Implement an iterator for array concepts ? - NOT for now

[X] Introduced support for *-type expectations

[X] Where else can we use macros with optional parameters
    [X] no real use for them so far

[X] Added Restore on concepts

[X] Fixed output manager bug on cloning on repeats

[X] Implemented a Quit discourse agency.

[X] Created OnCreation and OnInitialization

[X] Change last turn updated to lastbindingturnnumber

[X] Design for the grounding engine
    [X] How do you do with concepts that don't want to have a grounding model 
    [X] How about grounding on TRIGGERED_BY_COMMANDS

[X] Do we want HasCompleted to check thoroughly if the agent has completed ?
    [X] We'll try that for now. If we crash horribly, we'll see... :)


[X] What do you do for when you don't really want to ask the question
    unless it times out. Is that related to multiple questions ?
    That's just yielding the turn and can be implemented using a 
    TIMEOUT_PROMPT on an empty request

03-19-03 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] added macros for specifying server name and port

[X] Change FocusClaims so that they are pruned ... 

[X] Check out all the library agents. Why doesn't timeout work anymore?

[X] Review all discourse agents

[X] Look at IsAvailable(), what happens when you push something empty on history
    - it should still be not available

[X] Do the ValueToString changes...

03-14-03 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] Changes to increase readability (hopefully/somewhat)
    [X] USE_LIBRARY_AGENT("CRepeat", "Repeat", RegisterRepeatAgent) becomes
        USE_LIBRARY_AGENT(CRepeat, Repeat, RegisterRepeatAgent)
    [X] ITEM(start_time, CIntConcept) becomes
        INT_ITEM(start_time), etc BOOL/STRING/FLOAT/CUSTOM
    [X] SYSTEM_CONCEPT(CStringConcept, "user_name") becomes
        STRING_SYSTEM_CONCEPT(user_name) etc , same for user concepts
    [X] A("Logout").HasCompleted() becomes
        COMPLETED(Logout)
    [X] SUBAGENT(CPresentResults, "PresentResults") becomes
        SUBAGENT(PresentResults, CPresentResults)
    [X]	REQUEST_CONCEPT("user_name") becomes
        REQUEST_CONCEPT(user_name)
    [X] EXPECT_CONCEPT("room_query.room_number") becomes
      	EXPECT_CONCEPT(room_query.room_number)
    [X] A("Logout").HasFailed() becomes
        FAILED(Logout), similarily SUCCEEDED
    [X] C("want_reservation").IsAvailable() becomes
        AVAILABLE(want_reservation). there's also a NOT_AVAILABLE and an UPDATED
    [X] ((int)C("room_query.date_time.start_time") != (int)C("room_query.date_time.end_time")) becomes
        (C("room_query.date_time.start_time") != C("room_query.date_time.end_time"))
    [X] C("want_reservation").IsAvailable() && (bool)C("want_reservation") becomes
        IS_TRUE(want_reservation)   also, IS_FALSE

[X] Fixed IsAvailable()

[X] Implement equality/comparison operators on concepts

[X] Define shortcuts for concept types: CInt, CString, etc...

[X] Add support for Merged history objects in output prompts


01-28-03 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] ReOpen on agents does not "ReOpen" the concepts too. It just reopens
    the topic for conversation. The ReOpening of the concepts has to 
    be done independently... Hmm, still don't like this too much
        - [X] Maybe ReOpen, ReOpenTopic and ReOpenConcepts ?
        - [X] What does it mean to leave a topic open, versus just reopening 
            the concepts it contains ? 

[X] Extended syntax for grammar mappings to @(agent,agent)[slot] so that 
    you can specify more precisely when to bind

[X] Add ResetCounter and ReOpenCounter s
    [X] ReDo those now once you've redone the Close


01-21-03 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] Check if the expectation binds to the same concept, then don't consider it doubled

[X] Fix grammar mapping syntax for slots to [A.B.C].... right now it's [B | A]

[x] Fix memory leak on merged history objects in traffic manager

[x] Make the triggers work with reopens ? is there any reason for that ?
    - no, not really

[x] Check all the Clear()s to see if they do the right thing
    [x] Add a ClearCurrentValue

[x] Check whay happens when the core terminates... how do we notify the outside world ?

[x] Make history happen on concepts...

[x] Changed completion to success + failure completion
    [x] but might still need to make it explicit ? maybe ?

[x] Make the open request behavior on the default    

[x] Fix discourse agents to reflect MAX_ATTEMPTS
    [x] Check that MAX_ATTEMPS really works properly
    
[x] Put a check when no function name is given on a module in the traffic manager

[x] Review all discourse agents
	[x] help
	[x] repeat
	    [x] Check that OutputManager::Repeat works when you put the new discourse agent
	[x] suspend
	[x] terminate
	[x] TimeoutSuspend
		[x] to make this one work, make sure binding is case-insensitive
		[x] Also add a TimeoutTerminate
		[x] rename the file
		[x] briefly check that it all works
	[x] implement the context reestablishment for resume/suspend

[x] Made logging configurable
	[x] add more giDisplay messages to reflect incoming frames
	[x] add variable to RavenClaw configuration to disable dmiDisplays
		[x] actually did it with verbosities

[x] Make use of non-interruptable

[x] Make use of non-blocking


10-18-02 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Created project so that dialog task is separated
	[x] Created separate projects for BusLine, RoomLine, LARRI

[x] Change RUNProgramTests to RunDebugTests or something more reasonable

[x] The use of discourse agents is now configurable

[x] How can you re-start the dialog manager ?
	[x] added the end_session [TERMINATE]
	[x] but still need a terminate session agent
	    [x] check on why init_session fails though afterwards

[x] Actually check on the output manager
    Use a MUTEX object to ensure concurrency in the outputmanager
	- i.e. maybe critical sections would be best:
		InitializeCriticalSection
	- or with mutex
		CreateMutex 
	- ACTually, did it using Critical Sections

[x] Check out all of Drew's work on the output manager
    [x] Solve the concurrency control issue
	[x] Check on whoever uses Output::Create to check for false returns and do the right thing
	[x] what is the CFrameOutput::create auxiliary function used for ? 
	    - nothing, so took it out
	[x] Who deallocates cloned concepts ?
	[x] Look at Repeat and Notify
	[x] Introduce output history stream
	[x] Do the prompt parsing in the same way as in the TrafficManager agent
	[x] Object is better terminology than content, so let's do that
	[x] Eliminate checks for valid acts
	[x] Made sure LFOutput is in synch and nice

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] What's the best way of doing Delete, Insert, GetSize on concept
	arrays ? ... Given that we want polymorphism ?
	Just have them in there for now. Dynamic cast complicates the syntax
	too much

[x] Do we have a function that indicates if a certain agent is a topic
	of conversation ? 
	[x]	We do have an IsActiveTopic, but that seems to work at the level
		of tree, when it should actually work at the stack level, right ?

[x] Do we ever use or plan to use multiple output history ojects in 
    the output manager - no , so got rid of sDialogName and startid
    
[x] Make sure concept duplication in the output classes is ensured or not, 
    depending on how we want to do it... 

[x] Solve the interesting problem of recurring logs on undefined streams
    when deallocating agents. Which agents are allocated statically ?
	- fixed. it was because of the NULL agent trying to unregister itself

[x] how do you guard files so that they get compiled only under the right 
    configuration ?

[x] fix the galaxy includes so that they are not included any more in the OAA 
    version, define OAA, define GALAXY in the project
	[x] but still have to take out the input manager ones

[x] figure out a way to name the "common" interface, and do it
	- DMInterfaces

==============================================================================

[x] Keep writing on document


[x] check out the topics stuff, and think more about how the stack
	is implemented, what does it mean to be a main topic, etc, etc

[x] how do you make a trigger disabled when the agency is under the 
    main topic
	[x] Added IsActiveTopic
	[x] document it
	[x] test it, and with verbose/terse

[x] Add the comments at the begginning of each file

[x] probably need some sort of "NonExecutable" agent, that is 
	never planned for execution - NOT REALLY, solved it naturally

05-25-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Keep writing on document

[x] Continue on with LARRI
	[x] Finish the handling of steps in verbose mode
		[x] notes
		[x] cautions
		[x] phase transitions
	[x] Do some more testing in verbose mode
	[x] Figure out which are the main topics
	[x] Inspect the logs
	[x] Do a notification of task completion
	[x] Do the logout
	[x] Test suspend
	[x] Do the terse mode
	[x] Really update and clean the grammar
		[x] Send generic grammar to Tina
	[x] Create a new VSS project for all this stuff
		[x] Put the resources in

[x] Eliminated dispatch
[x] Rearranged DMCore so that construction/destruction of core takes
    place not in the DMCoreAgent any longer, but rather in DMCore

[x] Should focus claims check for their preconditions ? Yes.

[x] Implement a MountArrayOfAgents ?

[x] Look at the Galaxy Interface Stuff

[x] Do Mount versions with underscore and macros...
	[x] Actually, that's wrong. Do it without the underscores, but 
	    with special shortcut functions, like in the registry
	[x] Change that everywhere

[x] Rename/Rearrange dialogtask

[x] Relook at all warnings, see which are warnings, and which are really
	errors


05-18-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Elaborate the PopAgentFromExecutionStack routine to pop up even things that
    are not on top of it
    [x] Is that really needed ?

[x] Continue on with LARRI
	[x] completed tree building, including phase closing
	[x] and in more detail through the basic execution step
	[x] Start implementing them

[x] Add OnCompletion functionality for dialog agents ...
	[x] when is OnCompletion triggered ? 
		[x] changed it to when the agent is pulled off the stack
	[x] eliminated Finished with, move completed agent cleaning
		in the core
	[x] including Block and Reset

[x] See if you can do format string to return a string - ask Chris

[x] rename the private functions

[x] Add/correct to concept framework operators . References are ok.

[x] why does it freeze when mounting something unregistered
	- it doesn't, it actually returns a fatal error, but the streams
	  were not there. added logging error logging :)

[x] Start document

[x] talk to Drew about OM, NLG, Kevin
	[x] Give feedback on outputmanager
	[x] modify Coding style

[x] Maybe Mount should take a reference to the agent instead of a pointer
	maybe NOT !

[x] Do type checks on equality operators

[x] Fixed copy constructor in macro definition for structures
	[x] need it for arrays too ?	
	
[x] Need to fix operator= for CConcept& or not ? Talk to Chris

[x] Added ExpectCondition on expect agencies

05-04-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[x] Make distinction between topic and main topic

[x] Added GetSize on arrays.

[x] Changed the C() and A() functions to return pointers and
	overload them to work like printfs

[x] talk to Drew about OM, NLG, Kevin
	[x] Drew will get the changes in the OM
	[x] retouch the OM
	[x] email Drew Tue
	[x] once OM is done, do the nlg

[x] Add block upon completion functionality for dialog agents

[x] Introduced logging on the agenda

[x] Benchmark logging
	2.8 w Display and commit
	1.8 w Commit
	0.1 w/o
	[x] see if flush would work - seems to.
	
[x] changed backend symphony agents and task structure

[x] Change HasCompleted with SuccessCriteria
	[x] See what to do about expect agents in this case


05-04-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] implement the blocking stuff in the agenda

[x] Add timeout to request agent

[x] Add binding policy to request agent (for now)

[x] Move dialogagent outside the basic agents

[x] Implement resume/suspend agency
	[x] restrict dialog - do binding policy
	[x] check what happens when you say resume during other stuff

[x] Implement binding policies
	[x] change the agenda stuff to include blocked/non-blocked information

[x] talk to Drew about OM, NLG, Kevin
	[x] email Drew Tue
[x] Added resetuponcompletion functionality for dialog agents

04-27-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] talk to Drew about, Kevin
	[x] email kevin about the nlg
	[x] finish the help agency, decide what's domain.topic.subtopic
	    for discourse acts...
	    So, for certain agents, we can have
	    inform  (help.agentname)		Right now, I need you to tell me you name. 
	    inform  (context.agentname)		I'm trying to log you into the system. 
				(summarize.agentname)	Where are we ?
	    inform  (whatcanisay.agentname)	You can say ... 
	    
	    Well, I jusr decided we'll have an agent field

[x] Continue on with Symphony
	[x] Do the task retrieval and negotiation

[x] Update grammar for symphony with the task-independet slots
	[x] Help, repeat, suspend, resume

[x] Implement discourse methods on dialog agents
	[x] help
	[x] establish_context

[x] Implement execution policies for agencies
	[x] left-to-right open and left-to-right closed

[x] Do the casting operators for concepts

[x] Help - grammar for Symphony check that... 

[x] Do the "TRIGGERED_BY+CONCEPT" agency
	[x] So I think this functionality occurs often enough that 
		we can just plug it in the Dialog Agent (plus it's 
		just more complicated at this point to do it in 
		other ways)
	[x] Once that's done, redo the repeat 
	[x] and the help agencies...

[x] Switch the whole damn thing to construct/initialize/reset

[x] Make sure types for dialog agents, is the same as the one
     in the registry agentome

04-17-02
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Log termination phase for the DMCore more appropriately
	[x] also for the DTTManager

[x] Start thinking about how to implement the discourse agents
	that attach to the tree (see Repeat)
		[x] Mount
		[x] Unmount
	
[x] Implement the "ClaimsFocus" functionality

[x] Finish the includes (you left it at CoreAgents

[x] Finish the agenda
	[x] make sure it does the right thing (at least so far)
	
[x] Do the concepts = sign

[x] StateManager
	
[x] InputTurns (handled in the Input Manager)
	[x] How does the input manager handle things if they queue up ?
	
[x] Finish the galaxy calls
