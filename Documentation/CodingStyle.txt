                                  CODING STYLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS FILE BEFORE YOU INTERVENE IN THIS
CODE IN ANY MANNER. ADHEREING TO THE RULES BELOW WILL ENSURE STYLE CONSISTENCY
THROUGHOUT THE CODE, AND WILL SAVE A LOT OF PAIN LATER. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here's a list of people that have worked on this code so far. If you 
intervene in the code, please add your name to the table below

Name				Email					UserId			UserLetter

The coding style should be pretty obvious if you just look through the files. 
Here are a couple of indications. PLEASE ADHERE TO THEM, IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF
TIME AND PAIN LATER. If you have any questions, please contact Dan Bohus.

1. LOOK AT THE SOURCE CODE
Start by looking at how the sourcecode looks so far. It should give you an
idea about the minimal coding style required. 

2. SPACE YOUR CODE
Use spacing judiciously so as to increase the readability of the code. DO NOT
HAVE LINES OF CODE EXCEEDING 80 characters ! 

3. COMMENTS:

Please comment everything extensively. The criterion should be: "will someone 
reading the code will with no effort understand what's in here ?", otherwise
known as "The Principle of Least Astonishment". Here are some rules: 

- For each file, please update the history at the begining of the file, if you
  do changes to that file (i.e. even bug repairs). 
  
- Use the same commenting style you see in the other files. 
  
- Each function, structure definition, etc should be commented in the beginning. 
  Also each member of a structure should be commented.
  Provide at least a small explanation of what that function is doing. Use
  your UserLetter: to begin the comments, so that if someone has some problems
  with parts of the code, it will know where to go to ask. 
  
- In long CPP files implementing classes, group the functions (as in the 
  interfaces), and break the groups with comments (hierarhically)
  
  //-----------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // UserLetter: Bla bla bla... (this is a level 1 comment)
  //
  //-----------------------------------------------------------
  
  ... 
  ...
  
  //-----------------------------------------------------------
  // UserLetter: Bla Bla Bla... (this is a level 2 comment)
  //-----------------------------------------------------------
  
  // UserLetter: Bla Bla Bla  (this is a function comment)
  void CMyClass::AlwaysComment() {
	  // bla bla (inside the function you don't need to use your
	  // user letter)
	  ...
  }
  
  
4. HUNGARIAN NOTATION:

Use the following Hungarian notation: 

int iCount;				// an integer
string sName;			// a string
float fConfidence;		// a float
CDialogAgent* pMyAgent;	// a pointer
char* lpszName;			// a char *	(lpsz: long pointer to string terminated in 
						//           zero... don't ask why!)

TExecutionResult erFailure;		// a developer defined type (use initials in 
								// lowercase)
vector < string, allocator<string> > vNames;	// vectors
int& riNrOfConcepts;	// a reference to an integer


etc...


5. OTHER NAMING CONVENTIONS:

- All structures, functions, methods, classes, etc should have intuitive names.
  Think of it in these terms: someone looking at it should know just by the
  name kinda what it's doing. If that can't be the case (the name gets too
  long), then comment aggresively. 
  Take the time to think about what the name shoud be, what that function does. 

- Each word in a names should be capitalized. (i.e. ErrorTestingFunction)

- Private functions are to be named starting with a lowercase letter 
	(i.e.)
	private:
		errorTestingFunction()


6. MAKING NOTES FOR LATER ***

If you feel like something is not implemented completely, or completely 
correctly and you need to move on with the intent to later get back at that 
issue, please comment it and prefix the comment with ***. This will make
it easy to identify all the "unfinished/unoptimal" issues by doing a 
FindInFiles on ***. 


7. CLASS DECLARATIONS/DEFINITIONS

Define the interfaces for classes very clearly, and comment them. Try to group
the members by functionality. Comment aggresively on the members that implement
the main functionality of that class (look at CDialogAgent, CMAInform, 
CMARequest, CMAExecute for examples)
